Example of swagger codegen

At the beginning i was tented to use Swagger Codegen but then i changed to OpenApi Codegen.

Swagger Codegen and OpenAPI Codegen are two popular code generation tools that can generate client libraries, server stubs, and other code artifacts based on an OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification). Here's a comparison between the two:

Swagger Codegen:

Swagger Codegen was the original code generation tool developed by the Swagger community.
It supports generating code for various programming languages and frameworks, including Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.
Swagger Codegen has been widely adopted and has a large community of users.
It provides a variety of customizable options and templates to generate code tailored to specific use cases.
It supports both Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.x specifications.
Swagger Codegen has been used in many projects and has a proven track record.
OpenAPI Codegen (formerly known as OpenAPI Generator):

OpenAPI Codegen is a fork of Swagger Codegen that evolved into a separate project with additional features and improvements.
It offers enhanced support for OpenAPI 3.x specifications, including support for new features introduced in OpenAPI 3.x.
OpenAPI Codegen aims to provide a more modular and extensible architecture for code generation.
It supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, similar to Swagger Codegen.
OpenAPI Codegen continues to receive active development and updates from the OpenAPI community.
It provides a flexible templating system that allows users to customize the generated code.
In summary, Swagger Codegen is the original code generation tool developed by the Swagger community, while OpenAPI Codegen is a fork that offers additional features and improved support for OpenAPI 3.x specifications. Both tools are capable of generating code based on OpenAPI Specifications, and the choice between them depends on specific requirements, language support, community support, and personal preference.
